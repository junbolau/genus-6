This folder contains files used for the calculation for F_2-isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves over F_2. This follows a process similar to X. Xarles's genus 4 census computations.

- ```data_bielliptic.txt``` contains the isomorphism classes. Each line is of the form ```[ point count, group label, function field polynomial representation]```.
- There are 4134 isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves and the weighted count by the automorphism group is 2048.
- Running the bash command ```wc -l sorted_{0..24}.txt``` gives XXX hyperelliptic curve equations before isomorphism checks.

This is generated by the following files:

- ```hyperelliptic.ipynb``` contains the calculations for computing orbit representatives of hyperelliptic curves. The output file ```unfiltered.txt``` contains equations for hyperelliptic curves.
- ```pc_add.m``` adds point counts to the hyperelliptic curves. The bash script is ```data/RUN_pc``` and the output file is ```pc_unfiltered.txt```.
- ```pc_sort.sage``` sorts the curves by their point counts and divides into suitable sizes. The output files are ```sorted_{}.txt```.
- ```isom_class_check.m``` computes isomorphism classes. The bash script is ```data/RUN_isom``` and the output files are ```isom_sorted_{}.txt```.
- Running the bash command ```cat /data/isom_sorted_{0..24}.txt > data_hyperelliptic.txt``` combines the separate ```isom_sorted_{}.txt``` files into ```data_hyperelliptic.txt```.
