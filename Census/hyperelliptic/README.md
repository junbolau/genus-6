This folder contains files used for the calculation for F_2-isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves over F_2. The process follows a similar process to X. Xarles's genus 4 binary curves computations.

- ```hyperelliptic.txt``` contains the list of isomorphism classes
- ```hyperelliptic.ipynb``` contains the calculations for computing orbit representatives of hyperelliptic curves
- ```pc_check.m``` computes point counts for each hyperelliptic curve
- ```pre_isom.ipynb``` sorts the curves into point counts
- ```isom_check.m``` computes isomorphism classes
- ```sorted``` contain raw files (see ```hyperelliptic, pc_check, pre_isom,isom_check```)
- ```M_g_1_pc.m``` contains Magma script to calculate #M_{g,1}(F_2)
