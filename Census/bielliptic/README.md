This folder contains files used for the calculation of F_2-isomorphism classes of bielliptic curves over F_2.
  
- ```data_bielliptic.txt``` contains the isomorphism classes. Each line is of the form ```[ point count, group label, function field polynomial representation, base elliptic curve]```.
- There are 1530 isomorphism classes of bielliptic curves and the weighted count by the automorphism group is 744.
- Running the bash command ```wc -l sorted{0..9}.txt``` gives 5593 bielliptic curve equations before isomorphism checks. 

This is generated by the following files:
- ```curves_by_ramification.m``` computes bielliptic curves from ramification divisors in the base elliptic curves. ```data/RUN_ram``` is the corresponding bash script and the files are named ```{}.txt```
- ```pc_sort.sage``` sorts the equations by their point counts before isomorphism checks. Files are named ```sorted_{}.txt```.
- ```isom_class_check.m``` computes isomorphism classes. ```data/RUN_isom``` is the corresponding bash script and the files are named ```isom_sorted_{}.txt```.
