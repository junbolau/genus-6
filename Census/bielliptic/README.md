This folder contains files used for the calculation for F_2-isomorphism classes of bielliptic curves over F_2.
  
- ```bielliptic.txt``` contains the list of isomorphism classes
- ```curves_by_ramification.m``` computes bielliptic curves from ramification divisor 2D (where 0 <= deg(D) <= 5) 
- ```isom_class_check.m``` computes isomorphism classes and size of automoprhism groups (either of curves or function fields)
- ```functions.ipynb``` contains cells that sorts curves by point counts, and computing (non)-stacky counts of curves
- ```data``` contains raw files (see ```data_generation, curve_check, isom_class_check```)

The (nonstacky,stacky)-counts are:
- (1530,744)
