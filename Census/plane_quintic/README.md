This folder contains files used for the calculation for F_2-isomorphism classes of plane quintic curves over F_2.
  
- ```plane_quintic.txt``` contains the list of isomorphism classes
- ```data_generation.ipynb``` computes orbit representatives of plane quintic curves and performs initial point count checks
- ```curve_check.m``` computes point counts and checks for genus 
- ```isom_class_check.m``` computes isomorphism classes and size of automoprhism groups (either of curves or function fields)
- ```functionality.ipynb``` contains cells that sorts curves by point counts, and computing (non)-stacky counts of curves
- ```data``` and ```data/sorted``` contain raw files (see ```data_generation, curve_check, isom_class_check```)

The (non-stacky,stacky) counts are:

- (4204, 4096)a
