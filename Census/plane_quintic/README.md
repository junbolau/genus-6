This folder contains files used for the calculation for F_2-isomorphism classes of plane quintic curves over F_2.

- ```data_plane_quintic.txt``` contains the list of isomorphism classes. Each line is of the form ```[ point count, group label, function field polynomial representation]```.
- There are 4204 isomorphism classes of hyperelliptic curves and the weighted count by the automorphism group is 4096.
- Running the bash command ```wc -l sorted_{0..24}.txt``` gives 61129 plane quintic curve equations before isomorphism checks.

This is generated by the following files:
- ```data_generation.ipynb``` computes orbit representatives of plane quintic curves and performs initial point count checks.
- ```curve_check.m``` computes point counts and checks for genus. The bash script is ```data/RUN_curve_check``` and the output files are ```cc_{}.txt```.
- ```pc_sort.sage``` sorts the curves by their point counts and divides into suitable sizes. The output files are ```sorted_{}.txt```.
- ```isom_class_check.m``` computes isomorphism classes. The bash script is ```data/RUN_isom``` and the output files are ```isom_sorted_{}.txt```.
- Running the bash command ```cat data/isom_sorted_{0..24}.txt > data_plane_quintic.txt``` combines the separate ```isom_sorted_{}.txt``` files into ```data_plane_quintic.txt```.
- To get a representation in terms of x and y (instead of x0,x1,x2), do a find/replace (x <-> x0, y <-> x1, z <-> 1) by specifying an affine chart.
