- ```hyperelliptic.ipynb``` contains the calculation of genus 6 hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbf{F}_2$, following X. Xarles's genus 4 computations.
- ```qphypell.sage``` contains a dictionary of genus 6 hyperelliptic curves. \{q:\[p\]\} correspond to $y^2 + q(x)*y = p(x)$.
- ```ss_hyperelliptic,ipynb``` contains the calculation for supersingular hyperelliptic curves
- ```ss_pointcount.sage``` contains point counts (up to $\mathbf{F}_{2^12}$) of Weil polynomials of genus 6 supersingular curves
- ```weil_polynomials_ss_g6.sage``` LMFDB data of genus 6 supersingular curves


In ```ss_hyperelliptic.ipynb```, there are 8 supersingular hyperelliptic curves of genus 6.
